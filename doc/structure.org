* Components
** mcompress
** tptp2miz
   Convert a TPTP derivation into a corresponding Mizar article.

   May call mreprair, if the generated article has verifier errors.
** mrepair
   Given a Mizar article with some verifier errors, generate new Mizar
   articles (or Mizar text fragments) containing proofs that fill in
   the gaps reported by verifier.
** clausify
   Given a TPTP problem, extract a TSTP solution recording a
   clausification of the problem.  (*Not* the solution of the whole
   problem -- just the clausification.)
** ivy2tstp
   Concert an Ivy proof object into a TSTP derivation.
** ivy
   Given a TPTP problem, produce a TSTP solution with Ivy.

   Calls ivy2tstp and clausify.
